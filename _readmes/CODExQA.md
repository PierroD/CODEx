## Is CODEx safe to use ? <a name="qa1"></a>

Yes, and No.

You have to understand, that you will be `cheating, hacking` while using it, I would not be responsable if you get VACBan because of CODEx

## Which game is supported by CODEx <a name="qa2"></a>

At this time being it only supports the following games :
- Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 - Multiplayer
- Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 - Multiplayer
- Call of Duty Black Ops 2 - Multiplayer

##  My anti-virus software show CODEx as a virus is it normal ? <a name="qa3"></a>

No it's not, this version of CODEx isn't hidding any maliscious software, third part or any thing like this.

Try to add CODEx as an exception to your anti-virus software and re-download CODEx from this github repository.


## I can't find my configs where are they ? <a name="qa4"></a>

By default config files are stored in : `Documents > CODEx`

If not check the custom location you set in your CODEx application : `Settings tab` here you can see the config folder path.

## Why CODEx isn't starting/showing ? <a name="qa5"></a>

- Your computer is slow, let him time to load CODEx
- CODEx has been deleted by an anti-virus software, you have to re-install it

## Why is CODEx slower when I got a lot of results while looking for a DVAR ? <a name="qa6"></a>

C# application only got one thread for the UI (User Interface (What you can see... The app :smiley:)) so loading more than 50 UserControl will slow it down (I could replace it by something else but it would be as beautifull as it is :sweat_smile:

## How can I update CODEx ? <a name="qa7"></a>

Go in the `Settings` tab and click on the update button, it should do it work

 
## Can (you/I) improve something on CODEx ? <a name="qa8"></a>

Certainly I hope you could tell me what should I improve, **or** you can create/add a new feature to CODEx because it's an open source application :smiley:

`ps: I will love to see what you will be able to add so dm me if you improved CODEx`
